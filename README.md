# Artificial Neural Network Assignment

This project applies an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits using the UCI Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, with a series of experiments to analyze performance across different configurations.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-ann.git
cd artificial_neural_network
```

```bash
pip3 install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

```bash
python3 baseline_model.py
```

You can optional `cd` deeper into the folder structure to run the experimental versions or overwrite the root file with the one you want
